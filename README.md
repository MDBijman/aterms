# ATerms

This project implements [ATerms](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/publications/aterms2.pdf) in Rust. ATerms are a generic implementation of `terms`, a tree-like datastructure that can be used to represent programs.

ATerms are the datastructure of use in [Ters](https://github.com/MDBijman/ters) and [Tecs](https://github.com/MDBijman/tecs), DSLs for implementing programming languages.
